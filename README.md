1. **User Service**: Manages user authentication and authorization.
2. **Recipe Service**: Handles the creation, modification, and retrieval of recipes.
3. **Ingredient Service**: Manages ingredients and their details.

Each microservice is containerized and can run independently, communicating with each other as needed.
